# Super Bowl Prediction

For this project, my partner and I worked on a client-focused analysis of over 20 years of regular season NFL data, which included various team statistics and whether each team won the Super Bowl that year. After processing, scaling, and normalizing the data, I built a sequential neural network (SNN) to predict this year's Super Bowl winner. I used techniques like StandardScaler for normalization and SMOTE to balance the dataset and highlight key features. The model was trained on the most important features to make predictions based on past trends. The results were then compiled into a report and presented to the client, outlining key insights and predictions.
