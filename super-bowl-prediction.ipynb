        "For this analysis, we aimed to develop a neural network capable of predicting the Superbowl winner using mid-season team statistics. The dataset contains 704 entries for each teams offensive and defensive statistics through from 2002 to 2023, in order to predict the winner of the upcoming super bowl. Our goal is to minimize the features and use features integral for deciding the super bowl winner based on learned trends from previous years."

        "Before beginning analysis, it is crucial to load all packages and libraries required to perform an analysis. Pandas is crucial for loading and processing the dataset, and creating new features that might prove to be helpful. Matplotlib allows for plotting and creating different visuals that might prove to be necessary. Scikit-learn StandardScaler is used to standardize features, ensuring that each feature contributes equally to the learning process, preventing bias toward features with larger values. Scikit-learn train_test_split splits the dataset into training and testing sets in order to evaluate our model's performance. TensorFlow Keras is integral for building our neural network model. The Sequential tool stacks layers, ideal for feedforward neural networks, where we aim for a pipeline from input to output to predict the Superbowl winner. Dense passes inputs through layers of weights to return a probability score on the winner. SMOTE is crucial due to the likely class imbalance in the dataset."

Offense and defense games are excluded because the number of games is consistent across each team within a season. Offense and defense plays are removed because while it shows team strategy, it is not directly indicative of success in comparison to total yards and points. First downs gained and allowed are indirectly represented through total yards and points. Rushing first downs are a subset of total first downs, so they are removed to simplify the model. All penalty features are removed as while do affect game outcomes, they do not correlate with the ability to win the superbowl.

        "We felt that differential statistics were necessary in order to indicate team strength. Point differential is indicative of team strength by showing how much a team outscores its opponents. Teams with higher point differentials tend to win more often, making this a critical feature to include. Yardage differential shows if a team dominates in moving the ball and stopping opponents. Turnover differential highlights how well a team is at taking care of the ball compared to turning it over. This metric indicates of how well-rounded team is. Net score differential compares scoring efficiency on offense versus what it allows on defense. High net scoring means a team is efficient at both scoring and stopping others from scoring."

        "In this analysis, we created a sequential neural network model and trained it on historical NFL data to predict the most likely Super Bowl champions based on regular season performance from over two decades of historical data. The model was designed with independent probability predictions for each team, allowing us to highlight and assess individual team performance and make predictions that aren't negatively influenced by the probabilities of other teams.\n",
        "\n",
        "According to our model, the top three contenders this year are the Buffalo Bills, Baltimore Ravens, and Detroit Lions, with the Bills and the Ravens being the two closest. The model's output, showing distinct instances of teams standing out greatly in terms of win percentage, showcases the model's ability to identify top contenders based on the season data. The model emphasized efficiency and overall season strength, as reflected in the input features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our choice of input features was of great importance in this analysis, and the pruning of highly correlated features and selection of the most important ones aided us in avoiding overfitting and improving prediction reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "During testing, we found reasonable accuracy using historical data, confirming its capabilities to make such predictions. It is, however, important to note certain limitations and challenges in generalizing to future seasons, including potential biases from historical data, evolutions in the way the game is played over time, and black swan events like injuries or other unexpected events that can affect the outcome of performance, especially a binary event like the Super Bowl.\n",
        "\n",
        "On that same note, since the target which we're predicting is indeed a binary event, and a high-stakes, decisive one at that, we carefully made sure our methodologies and model input variables aligned with the ability to predict such an event. We chose net yards per play differential over total yards differential, for example, because a key factor in a high-stakes game is the ability to consistently gain yards per play and limit your opponent's yards per play. While net yards per play and total yards might both be good indicators of a team's dominance over a total season, total yards differential is less reliable in predicting outcomes in a single critical game where each contender is facing the league's best competition, and the most important factor is efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, by leveraging predictions reflecting individual probability of success on a team basis, using historical data and carefully chosen features, our model provides a useful lens for assessing the top champion contenders. While the analysis has its constraints, the model nonetheless provides an insightful data-driven approach for future predictions using past outcomes and further exploration of what characteristics best capture a those of a championship team.For now, we'll wait to see how the model's predictions play out come February. Time to start rooting for the Bills?"
